# WP3 Getting Started
This repository works as a reference point to access all WP3 material. 

## Minimum metadata model
The GECKO standardises attributes commonly used for genomics cohort description as well as individual-level data items. 
GECKO owl file can be accessed at [GECKO github repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IHCC-cohorts/GECKO/master/views/ihcc-gecko.owl).
GECKO model can be explored at [IHCC registry](https://registry.ihccglobal.app/ontologies/gecko) 

WP3 minimum metadata model used in development phase can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZXqTMIhFtGOaodw7Fns5YghvY_pWos-RuSa2BFnO5l4/edit#gid=0). 
For all the references we encourage to use owl file. 

## Synthetic datasets
All synthetic datasets are available in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1N6Baa7HqA_MJWLFGhB1cVt3Q4XJwPOHS). 
Synthetic data are also hosted at respective repositories as listed below. For more information about synthetic datasets refer to [synthetic_datasets.md](https://github.com/CINECA-project/wp3/blob/main/synthetic_datasets.md)

## Text Mining group
The text-mining team encompasses members from CINECA participant institutions such as SFU, EMBL-EBI, HES-SO, and UCT. 
The teams are initially focusing on building tools based on their prior experience/knowledge targeting specific cohorts. 
The goal is to expose each of them as (micro)services, which will then be made available via a collective interface for 
general cohort text analysis related tasks. For more information refer to [text_mining_group.md](https://github.com/CINECA-project/wp3/blob/main/text_mining_group.md).
