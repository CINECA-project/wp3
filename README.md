# WP3 Getting Started
This repository works as a reference point to access all WP3 material. 

## Minimum metadata model
The GECKO standardises attributes commonly used for genomics cohort description as well as individual-level data items. 
GECKO owl file can be accessed at [GECKO github repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IHCC-cohorts/GECKO/master/views/ihcc-gecko.owl).
GECKO model can be explored at [IHCC registry](https://registry.ihccglobal.app/ontologies/gecko) 

WP3 minimum metadata model used in development phase can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZXqTMIhFtGOaodw7Fns5YghvY_pWos-RuSa2BFnO5l4/edit#gid=0). 
For all the references we encourage to use owl file.
